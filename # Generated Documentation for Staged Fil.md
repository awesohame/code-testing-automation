## Documentation for Git Changes

This documentation describes the changes introduced by the provided Git diff.

### 1. File Changes:

*   **New File:** `.vscode/settings.json`
*   **Modified File:** `client/src/App.tsx`
*   **New File:** `client/src/pages/Test.tsx`

### 2. Detailed Changes:

#### a) `.vscode/settings.json` (New File)

*   **Added:** This file configures VS Code settings.
*   **Content:**
    ```json
    {
        "docGen.guidelinesPdfPath": "c:\\Users\\Admin\\Downloads\\dummy_guidelines.pdf"
    }
    ```
*   **Purpose/Impact:** This file specifies the path to a PDF document containing guidelines for a "docGen" extension. This likely configures a documentation generation tool within VS Code to use the specified guidelines.  This is related to the company guidelines and ensures compliance with documentation standards.

#### b) `client/src/App.tsx` (Modified File)

*   **Added:** Import statement for the `Test` component: `import Test from "./pages/Test";`
*   **Added:** A new route to the React Router configuration: `<Route path="/test" element={<Test />} />`
*   **Purpose/Impact:** This change integrates the new `Test` page into the application's routing system, making it accessible via the `/test` URL. This allows users to navigate to the `Test` page within the application.

#### c) `client/src/pages/Test.tsx` (New File)

*   **Added:** This file defines a new React component named `Test`.
*   **Content:** The component includes:
    *   State variables for API URL, test type, testing tool, virtual users, duration, additional checks, loading state, results, and error messages.
    *   A form that allows users to input parameters for generating performance tests.
    *   A `handleSubmit` function that sends a POST request to a backend API (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate`) with the form data.
    *   Logic to handle the API response, update the component's state with the results, and display error messages.
    *   A UI to display the results of the test generation.
*   **Purpose/Impact:** This component provides a user interface for generating performance tests. It allows users to specify various parameters, such as the API URL, test type, number of virtual users, and duration, and then sends these parameters to a backend service to generate the test configuration. The results are then displayed to the user. This component directly supports testing and quality assurance efforts.
